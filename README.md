# exe-packer
Written with Java's Launch4J in mind, Exe Packer adds files to the end of the EXE, and a simple interface to load those files in your app.  
Essentially it allows you to compress your whole game into one file, sort of like how the compact Minecraft exe used to work.

## Instructions
This should be pretty straightforward.  

/Compressor - The compressor host application compresses the executable.

/TestExe - Unit tests the application binary.  This is the interface to use to load your application data.

/Bin - TODO: remove this.  This was added by accident.
