# exe-packer
Simple Exe Packer.  Adds files to the end of the EXE, and a simple interface to load those files in your app.

## Instructions
This should be pretty straightforward.  

/Compressor - The compressor host application compresses the executable.

/TestExe - unit tests the application binary.

/Bin - TODO: remove this.  This was added by accident.
